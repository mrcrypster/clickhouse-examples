Grr! Linebreaks do not appear in the comment text!

The premise of the book seems to be that you're going to learn about how to run a startup by reading about successful ones-- that is, you're going to look at a bunch of successful startups, and say Hmm, what makes for a successful startup? 


Another way to put it is that you're trying to train a classifier-- how do you tell whether a startup is going to succeed? Well, if it has a, b, and c qualities in x, y, and z amounts. However, a key part in training classifiers is having negative as well as positive examples. It seems that from reading *just* about successful startups, you could incorrectly infer a bunch of necessary qualities for successful startups, when in fact those are qualities of all startups, or those are just qualities of the sample taken, and focusing on them is bogus. Having no direct experience in the matter, I can't give good examples, but it seems like you could fall victim to a breakdancing chicken problem: (made up example) all the interviewed startups wrote software, so writing software is an important step towards having a successful startups. Well, no, but it just happened that the interviewer focused on software startups. If you had examples of failed startups, you'd see that there was just sampling bias to","",0,""

321,"comment","simon","2007-02-21 17:18:54","As a former employee of Lands' End, I can attest to the quality of their customer service. (The quality of the internal employee care is less good than it used to be, since back when I started there in 1998, but I could just be bitter after the I/S department layoffs! :-)

Anyway, the whole customer service area is saturated in an ethic of serving the customer. It really is amazing. For example, there are no timers on the calls. Ever wonder why some CSR's are so brusk? Well, they're usually trying to beat the clock. If their average call time goes above some magic number (often as low as two or three minutes) then they get written up by their supervisor. No such problem at Lands' End.

I had to smile that Joel linked to the OCS (The Online Customer Store where he orders his logo'd shirts). I was one of the lead developers on that project. :-)

As for what happens to the returned items? They're sold off in the company employee store for a few dollars. If the company makes stipulations about the use of their logo, then a patch is applied over it, before selling to the employees, to protect the customers brand. As I recall, most customers don't mind.","",0,""

He converted HotOrNot from an S-corporation to a C-corporation.  You can certainly reinvest profits from an S-corporation into the business or pay out profits from a C-corporation as dividends, but the incentives go different ways.  S-corp earnings are taxed as ordinary income (none of the double-taxation of corporate profits) and S-corps can't give out different classes of shares, so there's an incentive to distribute the profits out to the shareholders.  C-corp earnings are taxed once at the corporate level and then once as dividend earnings, yet they can have multiple classes of shareholders.  The incentive is to build up the business and eventually seek an IPO, acquisition, or other liquidity event.

It almost looks like James is positioning HotOrNot to get big and get bought.","",0,""

We've had to enact a policy at our company- if you ask someone how their stay has been and they say &#34;well, it rained a few of the days,&#34; whatever you do, _don't_ say &#34;yah, sorry about that- too bad,&#34; even though that's the most natural thing in the world to say.  If we ever said sorry to something like that some would immediately demand a refund for their stay (funny as that sounds). Only apologize for things that really are your fault.  &#34;Sorry, my fault&#34; are magical words only when they are true (both parts).

The article has an interesting take on working out the dividing line between founders that are *involved* VS those who are *committed*.  But is this a good enough test?

I found out recently the distinction between 'involved' & 'committed' when a co-founder ditched out prefering to do a Phd (in the exact same area of the product) rather go the hard yards, build a product then sell it. Why? I can only guess. The Phd route could be perceived as less risky, higher prestige over the entrepreneurial route.  Maybe because all the &#34;chicks dig Phd's in CompSci&#34; ?

Using the above test the co-founder would pass. So how do you,  &#34;evaluate if a co-founder is committed over the entire product development timeline before any perceived payback&#34; ?

So it would be cool to do this with scientific papers and get people to register with university email addresses to generate trust and preserve fidelity. I know digg and reddit are pretty mainstream but allowing people to create specific knowledge networks on this platform would be cool.

I go to the University of Virginia, and to tell you the truth, it's nearly impossible to find good hackers to work on startups with (even though 50% of Reddit went here). And without that, there's no hope getting into something as prestigious as the YCombinator.<p>I propose we make a simple site that allows hackers find one another, locally. A single hacker isn't going to make a Meetup group to find other hackers; that takes too much work. It should be more like Craigslist, but for this startup community. Sorted by city, people can exchange email addresses, screen names, and most importantly, ideas. <p>All it takes is two founders, and you never know what kind of matches people will find. <p>Granted, they should know that they can work together before taking on a  huge project, but I think that something of this sort will really help people discover one another and get their startups going.<p>I'm not suggesting we re-invent Craigslist, but there are enough people here to merit something like this.

All that a good comment or submission tells you is that the submitter spends a lot of time surfing the web and is articulate. Unless you have solid reasons to believe that the two sets of qualities are strongly correlated, I am not so sure you should be even consider using this as a metric. Having worked in Silicon Valley for some time now, I can say that some of the smartest people around here have inadequate language (and by implication -- commenting) skills.

I have had a struggle finding cofounders that complement my style, skills, and ideas.  (Any coders out there that want to talk, hah?).  One thing I find missing from this list is that if you can't address these issues, or fore go these questions citing the fact that they will be addressed when the time comes (because coding is more fun) then you should rethink your partnership all together.  I find it much more important to ensure that anyone I am involved with is available for open and comfortable communication about all areas of the business.

There is obviously the group of hackers at CSAIL (Sussman et al.) that swear by LISP and the functional paradigms in general, but almost every class that involves a large amount of programming is in Java. Even 6.001 is being phased out for courses taught in Python.<p>As a current undergrad at MIT, I find myself sometimes struggling to determine whether I agree with Kevin or not. It does seem that my greatest selling point is my knowledge and experience with specific programming languages like Java and not any background I have in algorithms, discrete mathematics, etc. I feel that these other tools will prove more useful over the long term, but it's sometimes hard to continue to feel that way when the need for a summer job forces one to put away the common lisp book to read javadocs.","",0,""

Successful single founders is necessary to encompass a lot more characteristics. It's difficult enough to find 2 motivated people to take risk starting up, finding 2-in-1 it will be a lot harder. But if they try to avoid it, althout they don't exclude it, it doesn't mean it can happen at YC, or someone on his/her own.

For example take Facebook - they have possibly the most viral product ever seen on the web and after two years they still don't know what their killer revenue stream is and neither have they IPO'ed.

By the time you get a real good idea working you won't care if the whole world knows.  You know that as simple as the idea sounded, it's really thousands of hours of blood sweat dollars and tears.

Another cool metric is &#34;if your idea can be given away by telling someone&#34; then it doesn't have enough depth&#34; Most simple things are way more complicated when u do them - and thats in the thought of the implementation. <p>Just look at eBay - a platform for auctioning goods. The depth comes in generating a trust system (how?) then making it easy to list, and for people to send each other goods. Then each of these ideas can be fleshed out.

Considering that point in mind, I believe that the next big social network/startup will be much smaller than MySpace. We are in the era of super-niches; the market we appeal to will get smaller as the competition among startups increase.<p>That said, I would like to propose one &#34;lesson&#34; I did not mention in the article: &#34;As the target niche becomes more narrow, so will the funding&#34;. A niche that is sufficiently small might not attract any funding at all! So there is a downside to being small that must remain in check if you wish to attract funding. Enjoy :)

But if you just raise the money to live up to the convention, then you should think again.  The worst thing you could do is to go on a spending spree just to look busy.","",0,""

I don't know why the author thinks that people on sites don't communicate (maybe I missed the jist of the article entirely), but just because people aren't doing VOIP doesn't mean they have no 'voice'.

If a user is able to see the value of the service *before* putting something into it, they are more likely to understand the offering and accepting the reward for 5 minutes worth of forms.  There are so many services competing for users attention and everyone of them are fighting for their niche.  You have to put something on the table to gain the initial interest to keep the user on a site long enough to make it past the click of the back button.

Community ensures viral growth through word-of-mouth advertising and it gives value to the network directly proportional to the number of users.  I personally disagree that community is not necessary.  But, I don't think delicious does either.  For one, delicious has benefited greatly from it's community following.  Yes, it is a tool, and I do use it - under the normal circumstance - as an individual using a tool he own privately.  However, community allows me utility and efficiency when I can search for quality links tagged by others, or simply click tags that make sense when I'm saving a favorite.  I think you shouldn't use the word ignore here, it seems out of context.  Rather, I read him to mean you should focus on building a valuable tool for users and let the community follow.

Not having expectations of growing a startup to Facebook, Google or Bebo size you are going to be wasting a VC's time. This is no mean feat - you have to be mentally prepared to grow and scale a company like mad and similarly your startup must have proved its case for being able to scale.<p>Whats the best way to know if your startup is ready? build a prototype, get some traction, look at the numbers, measure, experiment then measure again. If you truly are going to scale (and you are growing at 1% a day) and you've experimented enough that you've found a suitable path you'll end up needing money of the VC scale.<p>It doesn't cost much to sit around and build something. Go and test it - figure out what people want first - change your assumptions and above all PROVE that if you scaled your site it'd be worth it for investors. You don't need VC yet to start something and test it out - If it comes to that point well thats something to think about.<p>I'm reminded of the story Michael Birch of Bebo tells - they built something, put it out there off the traffic of birthday alarm and experimented with features. Every time a feature added to the growth of the site and got a noticeable increase in users they kept it and tried something else which also contributed to the growth. By experimenting, measuring and then iterating for things which correlated for growth they ended up on the right path. When they had 5 million users and were growing month on month they had the numbers to prove themselves. They took $15m from Benchmark capital. The bottom line - you'll know when you are ready: just go prove the numbers. ","",0,""

967,"comment","reitzensteinm","2007-02-25 06:30:25","Yeah, it's probably not so applicable to consumer facing internet companies since the approach really needs a business to buy into the idea (much more willing to preorder, a single sale could fund the entire development). <p>Although maybe that depends on what you are creating. I could see something like Hotmail or Skype being bootstrapped with this method, because those services are useful to both individuals and businesses. Back then, email from any PC with the internet or free international voice calls would have been things that many businesses would have paid for (and still would, if there weren't so many free alternatives now). Even Reddit got its NYT deal soon after starting which pushed it into the black, did it not? (not rhetorical - I don't know much about their history so tell me if I'm wrong!)<p>There is the problem of loss of focus though. If a company like Hotmail started in '95, realised it could make millions selling their product to companies and focused on that (sales, turnkey servers for easy installation), they would probably only get a few years of that income at most before they are dethroned by a company that just focused on making the best web based email possible. So it would be a bit of a local maxmimum. Is this more dangerous than the loss of focus of doing something totally unhelpful/unrelated to the main product to bring in some cash (contracting, searching for investors) while simultaneously working on the final product? I'd like to know what everyone thinks.","",0,""

Lack of focus and quality:<p>In my experience, users frequent a site because it has quality content and they leave when the quality of the content declines.  Digg and more recently Reddit, are experiencing a loss of focus and quality and as a result are losing their initial users. Diggs quality is so bad it is now pointless to read and much to my chagrin, Reddit seems to be following suit.  
	
Reddit seems to be drowning in a rising tide of noobs.  Apparently, there arent enough old users around to down-vote the crap posted by the noobal hoard.

I dont think, by any stretch of the imagination, that Slashdot is perfect, but they do have a system where moderators are selected from heavy and moderate users on a rotating basis.

2.  No troll guards.  <p>1. Lack of focus and quality 
In my experience, users frequent a site because it has quality content and they leave when the quality of the content declines.  Digg and more recently Reddit, are experiencing a loss of focus and quality and as a result are losing their initial users. Diggs quality is so bad it is now pointless to read and much to my chagrin, Reddit seems to be following suit.  
	
Reddit seems to be drowning in a rising tide of noobs.  Apparently, there arent enough old users around to down-vote the crap posted by the noobal hoard.

978,"comment","hayeah","2007-02-25 08:35:24","I would second this. <p>In my mind, however, what would be more useful for us budding founders is a place where we can share our ideas and projects in their early embarrassing states. It would be nice the be able to get feedback right at the beginning when I have only the the vaguest idea, and then to be guided by feedback as the project develops and matures. I would not be comfortable to share my pre-pre alpha project on reddit. And people would not be interested.<p>I believe that the search-space is too great that we should ever worry about other people stealing our precious idea. Starting from one point, different people would diverge and develop in different ways.<p>I don't know. But I would really welcome more openness. I think when an idea is interesting, and new, people would rather cooperate, and help along. Competition only happens (I hope) when people are chasing after the roughly same fad.
